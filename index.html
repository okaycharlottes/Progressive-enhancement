<h1> The story</h1> 

<p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <q class="V">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <q class="F">Maybe.</q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q class="V">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <q class="F">Maybe.</q>

    The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q class="V">Oh dear, that’s too bad,</q> and the farmer responded, <q class="F">Maybe.</q> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="V">Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <q class="F">Maybe.</q>
    
    The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>  
<blockquote > <em class="good">Good </em> and <em class="bad">Bad</em> are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. <br>Let's not make a big deal out of it...</blockquote>
